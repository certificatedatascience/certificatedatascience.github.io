        <h1> Certificate in Data Science (CDS) </h1>    
Data science is not the future. It is here and now! Don’t get left behind!
We have created this course in response to the growing demand for data scientists around the world. Data science is  a blend of statistics, mathematics, computer science, machine learning and programming.CDS is course is distinctive because it focus on all the necessary foundations and the required skills to make a career in data science. Our students are trained in a combination of all these subjects to solve real life industry data science problems. We heavily emphasize  on hands-on programming of the  concepts taught in the class which makes the student industry ready from  day-one  for a lucrative career in  data science  in the industry.
World Class Data Science Training
Our instructors are from MIT, Harvard, University of British Columbia, Indian Statistical Institute (ISI Kolkata), IIT Kanpur with solid industry experience in data intensive, quantitative industries  in  USA, Canada and India. Each of our instructors is capable of teaching hand-on programming along with  mathematics, statistics, computer science, algorithms and large-scale data processing architectures such as Spark.
Your CDS journey
For your data science journey, we tailor the course specific to your needs based on your  current  level of knowledge. We  will provide  you with one-to-one training on programming,  careful feedback on your home-assignments, and assist you in completing the assignments for all modules. Moreover, we will assist you even if you don’t know where to start, or debug your code or how to complete it.  Our course material has been designed to equip you with the latest and highly sought after  machine learning and AI knowledge of the following module types.
Machine learning & AI methods
Programming with machine learning libraries
Machine learning with Bigdata: Spark 
Numerical methods for machine learning
Mathematics and statistical methods in machine learning
Industry oriented capstone project
To complete the CDS participants  will have to  carry out  an industry level projects, in data science and machine learning applied to industry based on the learning during the course. Our  instructors will help you in every stage of the project for final submission and completion of the CDS course. 

Getting into the  program
The CDS program is an open-ended program and comprises of many modules, stressing on various aspects of data science, depending on what kind of role you are targeting. To give our students individual attention we do not enrol more than 15 students in a batch. 
 
Unique program: highly industry focused
Personalized mentoring and tutoring to provide higher quality learning experience to the students. 
World class hands-on instructors on data-science, mathematics, statistics, computer science and programming with academic background from MIT, Harvard, University of British Columbia, ISI Kolkata and IIT Kanpur.
Our instructors worked in Wall Street, Fortune 500 companies, such as, Goldman Sachs (computational finance), KPMG (financial risk management) and derivative pricing), etc. and also mentored and trained and held academic positions in academic institutes such as MIT, Harvard, University of British Columbia (UBC).
The instructors trained and mentored  students with 100% success rate with subsequent placement in Google, Twitter, KMPG, Amazon in USA.
The instructors are very familiar with the Indian, American and Canadian educational systems and student culture, which allows them to understand and address difficulties experience by students from various backgrounds.
The instructors with provide extensive feedback on the home assignments.
The instructors have substantial experience in developing complex software tools in various programming languages, which flowered into full-fledged business.
The class sizes are kept small with no more than 15 students to give every more individual attention.
Each of our Instructors are well-rounded in programming, mathematics, statistics and computer science.
Our instructors are have published over international 60 papers, and holds US patents.  They have multiple degrees in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, computational finance, risk modelling.
We  have mentored students who are later place in great  jobs at Amazon, Google, KPMG, Twitter, Akamai in Canada and USA).
