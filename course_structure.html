          <h3>  Looking to enter or advance an exciting career in data science? </h3>
          <b>  This is the course for you! The data science industry boasts the highest number of opportunities in the today's global economy. Data science jobs requires 
           hands-on, practical skills blended with a
          well-rounded knowledge on mathematics, machine learning, statistics, algorithms, data-structure and programming, big-data systems and data visualization techniques.
 In this unique program, instructors teach these skills  
         during live interactive classes. Classes are taught using a combination of the following: formulation of problems, modeling and designing solutions on the whiteboard, and  explaining with screen-sharing while programming and debugging.
